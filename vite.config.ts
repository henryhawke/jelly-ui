 * Library build. Everything is bundled into a single ES module (the library
 * ships zero runtime dependencies), so the same dist/jelly.js works both as an
 * npm entry point and as a <script type="module"> from a CDN. CSS and SVG are
 * pulled in through ?inline / ?raw imports and inlined into the bundle at build
 * time, which keeps the authored source free of inline CSS-in-JS.
 *
 * Test config lives in vitest.config.ts.
