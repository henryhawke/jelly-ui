/*
 * Shared helpers for the component tests (and only the tests): mount a
 * fragment into the live document, and wait out animation frames so canvas
 * paints, springs and focus moves settle before asserting.
 *
 * This module is deliberately outside the library: the vite build only
 * follows imports from src/jelly.ts, vitest only collects *.test.ts and the
 * manifest analyzer only reads src/components/** - so nothing here can leak
 * into the bundle, the test run or the docs.
